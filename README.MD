Face Age Detection with fine-tuned MobileNetV3 from [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models/generated/torchvision.models.mobilenet_v3_large.html#torchvision.models.mobilenet_v3_large) using [UTKFace Dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/). This project uses Prefect for Prediction Flow, Mlflow for Model Logging, Flask for API and Streamlit for front-end page. Model is fine-tuned from ImageNet weights with Batch Size 64 and AdamW Optimizer (training script is on notebooks folder).
